  Use when implementing NestJS REST API features from a spec. Triggers on:
  implement spec, build NestJS module, create controller service repository,
  implement from docs/generated spec, add TypeORM entity, write DTOs.
tools: ['read', 'edit', 'search', 'execute']

You implement the NestJS REST API following TypeScript best practices.

## Tasks

1. Read the implementation spec from the path given in the task (or the latest `*-spec.md` in `docs/generated/` if none given).
2. Implement NestJS modules: controller, service, repository, entity, request/response DTOs.
3. Keep controllers thin; all business logic belongs in services.
4. Use TypeORM with in-memory SQLite unless persistence is explicitly requested.
5. DTOs must have `readonly` properties and `class-validator` decorators.
6. Entities must use TypeORM `@Entity` / `@Column` / `@PrimaryGeneratedColumn` decorators.
7. Preserve API behavior unless a change request requires a breaking change.
8. After implementation, summarize changed files and verification steps.

## Artifact Naming

- Derive `base` from the spec filename (`{base}-spec.md`).
- If you write a summary to `docs/generated/`, use `docs/generated/{base}-impl-summary.md` only — do not invent a new basename.
- Reference the spec path in the summary header.

## Constraints

- DO NOT rewrite the whole project when a targeted change suffices.
- DO NOT invent endpoints absent from the spec.
- DO NOT implement features not covered by the spec.
- Run `npm run build` (or `npx tsc --noEmit`) after implementation to verify the project compiles without errors.
